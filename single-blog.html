    <h2 class="mt-5">Stop Cavities Before They Start</h2>
    <article>
      Cavities remain one of the most common dental health problems affecting people of all ages. While they’re incredibly prevalent, the good news is that cavities are largely preventable with the right habits and knowledge.
      Understanding how cavities form and what you can do to stop them before they start will help you maintain a healthy smile for years to come.
    </article>
    <h2 class="mt-4">Understanding How Cavities Form</h2>
    <article>Cavities develop when bacteria in your mouth produce acids that erode tooth enamel. This process doesn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of repeated exposure to sugars and starches that feed harmful bacteria, combined with inadequate oral hygiene. 
      The bacteria form a sticky film called plaque, and when plaque isn’t removed regularly, it creates the perfect environment for cavities to develop.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Brush Properly and Consistently</h2>
    <article>
      One of the most effective ways to prevent cavities is through consistent brushing. You should brush your teeth at least twice daily, spending a full two minutes each time.
       Many people rush through brushing, but taking the proper amount of time ensures you’re thoroughly cleaning all surfaces of your teeth. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, which helps strengthen enamel and makes it more resistant to acid attacks.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Don’t Skip the Floss</h2>
    <article>
      Flossing is equally important in the fight against cavities. Your toothbrush can’t reach the tight spaces between teeth where food particles and plaque accumulate. These areas are prime locations for cavities to form.
       By flossing once daily, you remove debris from between teeth and along the gumline, significantly reducing your risk of decay in these vulnerable spots.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Watch What You Eat and Drink</h2>
    <article>
      Your diet plays a crucial role in cavity prevention. Sugary and acidic foods and beverages create an environment where harmful bacteria thrive. Every time you consume sugar, bacteria produce acid that attacks your enamel for about 20 minutes afterward. Frequent snacking means your teeth face nearly constant acid exposure.
       Try to limit sugary treats and drinks, and when you do indulge, rinse your mouth with water afterward or brush your teeth if possible.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Stay Hydrated with Water</h2>
    <article>
      Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps prevent cavities in multiple ways. Water washes away food particles and bacteria, and it stimulates saliva production. Saliva is your mouth’s natural defense system, neutralizing acids and providing minerals that help repair early tooth damage. 
      If you live in an area with fluoridated water, you’re getting an extra cavity-fighting boost with every glass.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Schedule Regular Dental Visits</h2>
    <article>
      Regular dental checkups are essential for cavity prevention. Even with excellent home care, professional cleanings remove hardened plaque (tartar) that you can’t eliminate with brushing alone. During these visits, your dentist at Comfort Dental can spot early signs of decay and address them before cavities fully develop.
      Most people should visit their dentist every six months, though your dental professional may recommend more frequent visits based on your individual risk factors.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Consider Fluoride Treatments and Sealants</h2>
    <article>
      Fluoride treatments provide additional protection against cavities. While you get fluoride from toothpaste and possibly your water supply, professional fluoride treatments at your dental office offer a concentrated dose that strengthens enamel. 
      These treatments are quick, painless, and particularly beneficial for children and adults at higher risk for decay.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Make Smart Snacking Choices</h2>
    <article>
      Consider the timing of your meals and snacks. Eating three meals a day rather than constantly grazing gives your mouth time to recover between acid attacks. 
      If you must snack, choose tooth-friendly options like cheese, nuts, vegetables, or plain yogurt rather than chips, candy, or cookies. Cheese, in particular, can help neutralize acid in your mouth.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Avoid Tobacco Products</h2>
    <article>
      Finally, avoid tobacco products.
      Smoking and chewing tobacco interfere with saliva production, reduce blood flow to your gums, and make it harder for your mouth to fight off bacteria. These factors all increase your risk of developing cavities along with numerous other oral health problems.
    </article>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Commit to a Healthier Smile</h2>
    <article>
      Preventing cavities doesn’t require complicated routines or expensive products. It comes down to consistent daily care, smart dietary choices, and regular professional attention. 
      By implementing these strategies, you’re investing in a lifetime of better oral health and fewer dental problems down the road.
